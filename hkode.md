# Herringway's Kode of Battle

## Introduction

Welcome to Herringway Arena! Test your skills against famous bosses of all types in this collaborative RPG system.

Each battle consists of one or more enemies, a ref to keep things moving (mostly) and plenty of player-controlled combatants. The goal is to defeat the enemies by cooperating with your teammates, usually by reducing the HP of the enemies to zero before they do the same to you.

## Terms

* A-Skill: Active Skill. These are skills that you purchase with XP and can use whenever your turn comes up.
* Arena Barrier: Similar to the ref barrier, this barrier protects the audience from everything going on in the arena. The reverse is also true - those inside the arena are safe from those who are outside.
* Caster: Refers to whoever is using an ability, regardless of whether or not it is magical or physical.
* HP: Health Points. Run out of these and you're dead! Hope someone else is merciful...
* P-Skill: Passive Skill. These are skills that you purchase with XP and provide various effects, like increased magic strength or HP absorbing.
* RCP: Referee Control Panel. This wonderful device is responsible for all the arena functions, from protecting the audience and ref to simple stat displays. Occasionally crashes or glitches. Usually operated by the ref, but not always...
* Ref: Short for referee. The person refereeing is responsible for keeping the battle moving, resolving conflicts and generally making sure things stay fun, even if that means ending the battle. Ingame, the ref is responsible for operating the RCP and is an active part of battles. Normally, the ref is present but protected by a ref barrier, preventing any negative effects from affecting them. But when the barrier goes down... beware.
* Ref Barrier: This barrier is projected by the RCP on the ref and RCP itself during normal operation. Whoever is protected enjoys immunity to everything thrown about the arena.
* SP: Skill/Spell points. You can spend these in battle to use your abilities.
* Unit: A specific combatant in the battle.

## Battle Objectives

The ultimate goal of a battle is to defeat your opponents.

* Standard Rules: Reduce your opponents to 0HP before they do it to you.
* Survival Battle: In these battles, you fight for your survival in harsh arena conditions. Hazard set is permanently set to evil and the RCP is likely in need of a reboot.
* Coin Battle: Gain money when dealing damage. Participants cannot die in this battle type.
* Horde Battle: No boss, just lots of enemies. Defeat as many as you can!
* Player Vs Player: Your opponents are other players!
* Party: Anything can happen, but it's probably good!
* JOKAR: ha ha ha

## Turn System

Each battle is divided into (hopefully several) rounds. At the start of each round, players choose an action to take. Once everyone has decided what they will do, the actions will execute, with the fastest combatants going first and the slowest going last. Some status effects change the number of turns a player will get in a round. Enemies may be able to take multiple turns as well.
